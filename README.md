# Risk_Analytics_EDA




## Introduction 

The loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to the people due to their insufficient or non-existent credit history. Because of that, some consumers use it to their advantage by becoming a defaulter. 

In this project, we will use Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) to help a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. We will analyze the data to ensure that the applicants capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.

When a company receives a loan application, the company has to decide for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
  - If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
  - If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the   company.
  
## Business Objectives 

- Ensuring that customers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. 
- Find the driving factors behind loan default. 
- Identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their instalments so the company can take decisions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate.
